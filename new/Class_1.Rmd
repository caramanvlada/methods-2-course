## Exercise 1
```{r}
#1.1 create a vector of the names of your study group
study_names <- c("sigurd","laura","niels","sara")

#1.2
sg_sib <- c(4,1,0,2)

#1.3
study_names + 2
sg_sib + 2 

#1.4
class(study_names) #String/character
class(sg_sib) # numeric/integer

#1.5
sum(sg_sib) #sum of all siblings in the group
sum(sg_sib[c(1,3)]) #sum of number 1 and 3 in the groups siblings.
sum(sg_sib[1:3]) #sum of 1 to 3
#1.6
sg_sib[1] * sg_sib[2] #product = 4


#Extra
#1
name <- Peter #You need "Peter" to specify it is a string.
#2
mix_vector <- append(sg_sib, "Word")
#3
mix_vector * 2 #you cannot as it isnt solely integers
#4
mix_vector <- mix_vector[-(5)] #or another way is could be... mix_vector <- mix_vector[1:4]
mix_vector * 2 #Adding a string ealier changed the entire vector to a string
as.numeric(mix_vector) * 2 #Change vector to numeric and you can multiply. 

```
## Exercise 2
```{r}
#2.1
study_group_df <- data.frame(Names = as.character(study_names), Siblings = as.numeric(sg_sib))
#2.2
study_group_df$Gender <- as.factor(c("M","F","M","F"))
#2.3
study_group_df_new <- rbind(study_group_df, c("Emma",1,"F"))
#2.4
mean(study_group_df_new$Siblings) #error
class(study_group_df_new$Siblings) #it has been turned into character
study_group_df_new$Siblings <- as.numeric(study_group_df_new$Siblings)
class(study_group_df_new$Siblings) #now it is numeric
mean(study_group_df_new$Siblings)
#2.5
study_group_df_new <- cbind(study_group_df_new, actual_sib = c(4,0,3,6,3)) #adding a new collum of acutal siblings

#2.6
study_group_df_new <- cbind(study_group_df_new, sib_diff = study_group_df_new$Siblings - study_group_df_new$actual_sib) #Here I add another column with the difference between my guess and the real value of siblings. 

```

## Exercise 3
```{r}
#3.1
sum(study_group_df_new$actual_sib == 3)

#3.2
sum(study_group_df_new$actual_sib >= 3)

#3.3
?length
length(study_group_df_new$Names) #Shows me how many elements there are saved in an object.

#3.4
mean(c(2,7,"Cat")) #Cat is not numeric so cannot compute mean.

#3.5
#A comma is missing between the two statements. data.frame(names = names, n_pets = n_pets)

#3.6
subset(study_group_df_new, sib_diff == 0) #I only want those in the data frame where the sib_difference is 0. 
```
